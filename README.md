# Music Genre Classification

A Machine Learning based project that classifies music into different genres by analyzing audio features from songs using **Librosa** and training ML/DL models.

---

## Project Overview
This project extracts important audio features like:
- MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)
- Chroma Feature
- Mel Spectrogram
- Spectral Contrast
- Tonnetz

These features are used to train classification models to predict music genres accurately.

---

## Models Used
- Machine Learning models (Random Forest / SVM / etc.)
- Deep Learning models (CNN using TensorFlow/Keras)

---

## Dataset
- **GTZAN Music Genre Dataset**
- **Link**-https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carlthome/gtzan-genre-collection
- 10 genres with 100 audio files each (30 seconds long)
